/**
 * An Inertial Measurement Unit that provides robot-centric orientation and angular velocity.
 * <p>
 * All measurements are in the Robot Coordinate System. In the Robot Coordinate System, the X axis
 * extends horizontally from your robot to the right, parallel to the ground. The Y axis extends
 * horizontally from your robot straight ahead, parallel to the ground. The Z axis extends
 * vertically from your robot, towards the ceiling.
 * <p>
 * The Robot Coordinate System is right-handed, which means that if you point the thumb of a typical
 * human right hand in the direction of an axis, rotation around that axis is defined as positive in
 * the direction that the fingers curl.
 * <p>
 * Orientation values are relative to the robot's position the last time that {@link #resetYaw()}
 * was called, as if the robot was perfectly level at that time.
 * <p>
 * The recommended way to read the orientation is as yaw, pitch, and roll angles, via
 * {@link #getRobotYawPitchRollAngles()}. See the {@link YawPitchRollAngles} documentation for a
 * full description of how the angles get applied to each other. That class's documentation will
 * duplicate some information found here, but will not cover how yaw, pitch, and roll work in the
 * specific context of an IMU that implements this interface.
 * <p>
 * Yaw is the side-to-side lateral rotation of the robot. In terms of the Robot Coordinate
 * System, it is defined as how far the robot has turned around the Z axis. Sometimes yaw is also
 * referred to as "heading". The yaw can drift slowly over time, because most implementations do not
 * use a magnetometer as an absolute reference (magnetometer readings are disrupted by nearby
 * motors). The yaw reference is <i>preserved between Op Mode runs</i>, unless the Robot Controller
 * application is restarted, the Restart Robot option is selected, or the second Op Mode calls
 * {@link #resetYaw()}. This means that your yaw reference point can remain consistent through both
 * the Autonomous and TeleOp phases of the match.
 * <p>
 * Pitch is the front-to-back rotation of the robot. In terms of the Robot Coordinate System, it is
 * how far the robot has turned around the X axis. Pitch uses gravity as an absolute reference, and
 * will not drift over time.
 * <p>
 * Roll is the side-to-side tilt of the robot. In terms of the Robot Coordinate System, it is
 * defined as how far the robot has turned around the Y axis. Roll uses gravity as an absolute
 * reference, and will not drift over time.
 * <p>
 * All angles are in the range of -180 degrees to 180 degrees.
 * <p>
 * The default orientation of the IMU on the robot will be implementation-specific. For the BNO055
 * and BHI260AP implementations, the default is for a REV Control or Expansion Hub that is oriented
 * with the USB ports facing the front of the robot and the REV logo facing the ceiling. To specify
 * a non-default orientation on the robot, you need to call {@link #initialize(Parameters)}.
